      "title": "Java - When to Use public, private, static, void, and Classes",
      "answer": "EXPLANATION:\n\n1. **public**:\n➤ Used to make a class, method, or variable accessible **from anywhere** (any package/class).\n➤ Example:\n```java\npublic class Car {\n    public void start() {\n        System.out.println(\"Car started\");\n    }\n}\n```\n- You can access `start()` method from another file or class if both are compiled.\n\n2. **private**:\n➤ Used to restrict access **only within the same class**.\n➤ Commonly used for internal/helper methods or data encapsulation.\n➤ Example:\n```java\npublic class Car {\n    private String engineType = \"Diesel\";\n\n    private void checkEngine() {\n        System.out.println(\"Checking \" + engineType);\n    }\n}\n```\n- `checkEngine()` and `engineType` cannot be accessed outside the `Car` class.\n\n3. **static**:\n➤ Used to make a method or variable **belong to the class instead of an object**.\n➤ Can be accessed without creating an object.\n➤ Common for utility functions or `main()` method.\n➤ Example:\n```java\npublic class MathUtils {\n    public static int square(int x) {\n        return x * x;\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage:\nint result = MathUtils.square(5); // No object needed\n```\n\n4. **void**:\n➤ Used when a method **does not return any value**.\n➤ Example:\n```java\npublic void printHello() {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello!\");\n}\n```\n- This method just performs an action, no return value.\n\n5. **When to Create a Class**:\n➤ Create a class when you want to represent a real-world **entity** (like `Car`, `Student`, `BankAccount`) or when you need to **group data and methods** logically.\n➤ Example:\n```java\npublic class Student {\n    String name;\n    int age;\n\n    public void study() {\n        System.out.println(name + \" is studying\");\n    }\n}\n```\n- You can then create multiple objects of `Student` with different data.\n\nSUMMARY:\n- Use **`public`** for global access.\n- Use **`private`** for internal logic.\n- Use **`static`** for utility/shared logic.\n- Use **`void`** for methods that don't return values.\n- Use **classes** to group related data and methods."

      "title": "How to find the majority element in an array using HashMap? Explain algorithm, complexity, dry run, and key loop.",
      "answer": "APPROACH / ALGORITHM USED:\n- Use a HashMap to store the frequency of each element in the array.\n- Traverse the array once and for each element nums[i], update the count using:\n  map.put(nums[i], map.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);\n- After building the frequency map, iterate over each key in map.keySet() and check if map.get(key) > nums.length / 2.\n- If such a key is found, return it as the majority element. Otherwise, return -1 (if the majority is not guaranteed).\n\nTIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY:\nTime: O(n)\n- O(n) to build the map + O(n) to iterate map keys.\nSpace: O(n)\n- In the worst case, all elements are unique and stored in the map.\n\nDRY RUN / EXAMPLE:\nInput: [3, 1, 3, 3, 2]\n\nStep 1 (Build map):\n- Add 3 → {3=1}\n- Add 1 → {3=1, 1=1}\n- Add 3 → {3=2, 1=1}\n- Add 3 → {3=3, 1=1}\n- Add 2 → {3=3, 1=1, 2=1}\n\nStep 2 (Check majority):\n- Array length = 5 → n/2 = 2\n- map.get(3) = 3 > 2 → return 3\n\nFinal Output: 3\n\nEXPLANATION OF for (Integer key : map.keySet()):\n- This loop goes through each unique number in the array.\n- For example, with map = {3=3, 1=1, 2=1}, the loop iterates key = 3, 1, 2.\n- It checks if map.get(key) > n/2 → returns the key if true.\n\nOPTIMIZED APPROACH USING MOORE’S VOTING ALGORITHM:\n- Initialize count = 0 and candidate = None\n- Traverse the array:\n  - If count == 0, set candidate = current element\n  - If current element == candidate, increment count\n  - Else, decrement count\n- This finds a candidate that could be the majority\n- To confirm, do a second pass to count its actual frequency\n- If frequency > n/2, return candidate, else return -1\n\nDRY RUN (MOORE'S ALGORITHM):\nInput: [3, 1, 3, 3, 2]\n\nPass 1 (Find candidate):\n- count = 0 → candidate = 3 → count = 1\n- 1 ≠ 3 → count = 0\n- count = 0 → candidate = 3 → count = 1\n- 3 == 3 → count = 2\n- 2 ≠ 3 → count = 1\nCandidate after pass 1 = 3\n\nPass 2 (Verify candidate):\n- Count occurrences of 3 → frequency = 3\n- 3 > 5/2 → return 3\n\nTime: O(n), Space: O(1)"

      title: "(question - Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store) Approach / Algorithm Used",
      answer: `APPROACH / ALGORITHM USED:
    - Goal: Distribute products among \`n\` stores such that the **maximum number of items in any one store is minimized**.
    - Each product type must be split into multiple stores, but the same type can be distributed across different stores.
    - We are trying to **minimize the maximum load** that a store can have — this is a classic use case for **Binary Search on Answer**.
    
    OPTIMIZED APPROACH (Binary Search on Answer):
    1. Let \`left = 1\` (minimum possible max load), \`right = max quantity in the array\` (worst case where all go in one store).
    2. Use binary search between \`left\` and \`right\`:
       - For mid = candidate max load, check: **Can we assign products such that no store gets more than mid items?**
       - To check this, calculate how many stores are needed for each product type:
         - \`stores += ceil(quantity / mid) = (quantity + mid - 1) / mid\`
       - If total stores needed ≤ n → try smaller \`mid\` → \`right = mid\`
       - Else → try bigger \`mid\` → \`left = mid + 1\`
    3. Final \`left\` is the minimized maximum load.
    
    TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY:
    Time Complexity: O(m * log M), where m = quantities.length and M = max(quantities[i])
    - For each binary search step (log M), we scan quantities once (O(m)) to count stores.
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Constant space used.
    
    EXAMPLE:
    n = 6, quantities = [11, 6]
    - Try mid = 6 → stores needed: ceil(11/6) + ceil(6/6) = 2 + 1 = 3 → OK
    - Try mid = 3 → stores needed: ceil(11/3) + ceil(6/3) = 4 + 2 = 6 → OK
    - Try mid = 2 → 6 + 3 = 9 > 6 → too small

    - The array has all elements in pairs except one single element.

    1. Initialize \`left = 0\`, \`right = nums.length - 1\`.
    2. While \`left < right\`:
       - Find mid: \`mid = (left + right) / 2\`
       - Ensure \`mid\` is even (so it pairs with \`mid+1\`)
       - If \`nums[mid] == nums[mid+1]\` → single is on right → \`left = mid + 2\`

    - The goal is to partition both arrays such that all elements on the left are <= all elements on the right.

      answer: `APPROACH / ALGORITHM USED:
    - This is a classic **Backtracking** problem where we try to build all combinations that sum up to the target using given candidates.
    - Each number can be used **unlimited times**. So we make recursive calls without incrementing the index after choosing a number.
    
    STEPS:
    1. Define a backtrack function with parameters: \`candidates\`, \`target\`, \`index\`, \`currentList\`, and \`result\`.
    2. Base Case 1: If \`target == 0\`, we've found a valid combination → add copy of current list to result.
    3. Base Case 2: If \`target < 0\` or \`index >= candidates.length\`, return (invalid path).
    4. Recursive Case:
       - **Include** current candidate → reduce \`target\`, do **not** increment index since reuse is allowed.
       - **Exclude** current candidate → move to next index.
    5. After including a candidate, always backtrack (remove the last added element) to explore other combinations.

    - To avoid duplicates in output, we **sort the array** and **skip duplicate candidates** during recursion.

    3. Base Case: If \`target == 0\`, add a deep copy of \`current\` to \`result\`.
    4. Loop from \`start\` to end of array:
       - Skip duplicate elements: if \`i > start && candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]\`, continue.
       - If \`candidates[i] > target\`, break — no need to explore further.
       - Include \`candidates[i]\` and recurse with \`i + 1\` (since each number is used once).

      title: "(question - Sudoku Solver) Approach / Algorithm Used",
      answer: `APPROACH / ALGORITHM USED:
    - Use **Backtracking** to fill the 9×9 Sudoku board.
    - Try placing numbers '1' to '9' in each empty cell ('.'), validating with Sudoku rules before placement.
    
    STEPS:
    1. Traverse the board cell-by-cell using nested loops.
    2. When an empty cell is found:
       - Try placing numbers from '1' to '9'.
       - For each number, check if it's **valid**:
         - Not present in the same row.
         - Not present in the same column.
         - Not present in the 3x3 subgrid.
    3. If valid, place the number and recursively call solve on the updated board.
    4. If recursion returns true → solution found.
    5. If no valid number can be placed → backtrack by resetting the cell and trying next number.
    6. Once all cells are filled correctly, return true.
    
    TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY:
    Time Complexity: O(9^(n)) where n is the number of empty cells
    - Each empty cell can try up to 9 digits.
    Space Complexity: O(1) extra (in-place), excluding recursion stack.
    
    EXAMPLE:
    Input (partial board with '.'):
    [
     ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],

    - Use **Backtracking** to try assigning colors to each vertex from 1 to m and check if it's safe.
    
    STEPS:
    1. Build an adjacency list from the given edge list.
    2. Initialize a \`colors[]\` array of size \`v\` to track the color of each vertex. Initially, all are uncolored (0).
    3. Start DFS (depth-first search) from node 0:
       - For each node, try assigning colors from 1 to m.
       - Before assigning, use \`isSafe()\` to check if any adjacent vertex has the same color.
       - If safe, assign the color and recurse for the next node.
       - If all nodes are colored without conflicts, return true.
       - If no color works, backtrack and try a different color.

    2. Use a 1D array \`dpPrev[]\` to represent previous row of DP table (space optimized).
    3. For each i from 1 to n:
       - Calculate prefix sum of \`dpPrev[]\` for efficient range summation.
       - For each possible inversion count inv, compute valid range of previous inversions.
       - Use prefix sum to compute dp[i][inv] = sum of dp[i-1][inv-k] for all valid k.
    4. After filling dp for i, apply any inversion constraint that matches i - 1 by filtering \`dpPrev[]\` to a single valid inversion count.
    5. After processing all elements, sum all entries of \`dpPrev[]\` to get the final answer.
    
    TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY:
    Time Complexity: O(n^2)
    - Outer loop for n elements, inner loop for all possible inversions (at most n*(n-1)/2).
    Space Complexity: O(n^2) → Optimized to O(n) with 1D arrays.
    
    EXAMPLE:
    Input: n = 3, requirements = [[1,0], [2,1]]
    - We must ensure: first 2 elements (0-based index) form 0 inversion; first 3 form 1 inversion.
    - Valid permutation: [1, 2, 3] → satisfies both requirements

      title: "(question - Reverse Linked List) Approach / Algorithm Used",
      answer: `APPROACH / ALGORITHM USED:
    - Use **Iterative Pointer Manipulation** to reverse the singly linked list in-place.
    - Maintain 3 pointers: \`prev\`, \`curr\`, and \`nextTemp\`.
    - At each step, reverse the current node’s pointer and move all pointers one step ahead.
    
    STEPS:
    1. Initialize \`prev = null\` and \`curr = head\`.
    2. Loop until \`curr != null\`:
       - Store \`curr.next\` in \`nextTemp\`.
       - Reverse the link: \`curr.next = prev\`.
       - Move \`prev\` to \`curr\` and \`curr\` to \`nextTemp\`.
    3. When loop ends, \`prev\` points to the new head of the reversed list.
    
    TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY:
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Each node is visited once.
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    - No extra space is used, just pointers.

    - Append the smaller node to a new result list and move the pointer forward in that list.
    - Use a **dummy node** to simplify edge cases and handle the head of the result list.
    - After the loop, append any remaining nodes from either list.

    STEPS:

      title: "(question - Add Two Numbers) Approach / Algorithm Used",
      answer: `APPROACH / ALGORITHM USED:
    - Simulate the addition of two numbers represented by linked lists.
    - Start from the least significant digit (head of each list).
    - Maintain a carry for sums ≥ 10 and construct the result as a new linked list.
    
    STEPS:
    1. Initialize a dummy node to simplify result list handling.
    2. Use a pointer \`curr\` to build the result list and a variable \`carry = 0\`.
    3. Loop while either list has nodes left or carry is non-zero:
       - Add corresponding node values and carry.
       - Store \`sum % 10\` in new node and update carry as \`sum / 10\`.
    4. Return \`dummy.next\` (head of the result list).

We then sort this array to ensure all cuts are processed in order.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n- Define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum cost of making all cuts between `allCuts[i]` and `allCuts[j]` (i.e., between two cut positions, or between the start and the end).\n- The base case: `dp[i][i+1] = 0` (no cuts needed between two adjacent cuts).\n- For each possible length between cuts, calculate the minimum cost by trying all possible intermediate cuts `k` between `i` and `j`, and using the recurrence relation: `dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], allCuts[j] - allCuts[i] + dp[i][k] + dp[k][j])`.\n- The result will be in `dp[0][c + 1]`, which represents the minimum cost to make all cuts between the start and the end of the stick.\n\nTIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY:\n- Time: O(c^3), where c is the number of cuts.\n- Space: O(c^2) for the DP table.\n\nDRY RUN / EXAMPLE:\nInput: n = 7, cuts = [1, 3, 4, 5]\n\nStep 1: `allCuts[]` = [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7] (sorted cuts)\nStep 2: Initialize the DP table.\nStep 3: Fill the DP table by calculating the cost of cuts for every subproblem.\n\n✔️ Final Output: 16"

        title: "What is encapsulation?",
        answer: "Encapsulation is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming. It means bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit — a class. It also involves hiding the internal details of objects from outside access using access modifiers like `private`.\n\nJava Example:\n```java\nclass Account {\n  private String password;\n\n  public Account(String pwd) {\n    this.password = pwd;\n  }\n\n  public void setPassword(String pwd) {\n    this.password = pwd;\n  }\n\n  public String getPassword() {\n    return this.password;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The field `password` is marked `private`, so it can't be accessed directly from outside the class.\n- Instead, it's accessed and modified using `getPassword()` and `setPassword()` methods.\n- This is encapsulation: protecting data by restricting direct access and exposing it only through controlled methods."

        title: "What is a deep copy?",
        answer: "A deep copy creates a completely independent copy of an object, including all objects or arrays it refers to.

        answer: "Both abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in Java, but they differ in key ways:\n\n**Key Differences:**\n- **Abstract class:** Can have method implementations (concrete + abstract methods), constructors, and instance variables.\n- **Interface:** Can only have abstract methods (Java < 8). From Java 8 onward, it can also have default and static methods.\n- **Inheritance:** A class can extend only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces.\n- **Usage:** Use abstract class when providing base behavior. Use interface to define capability or contract.\n\nJava Example:\n```java\n// Abstract class example\nabstract class Animal {\n  abstract void sound();\n  void sleep() {\n    System.out.println(\"Sleeping...\");\n  }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n  void sound() {\n    System.out.println(\"Bark\");\n  }\n}\n\n// Interface example\ninterface Flyable {\n  void fly();\n}\n\nclass Bird implements Flyable {\n  public void fly() {\n    System.out.println(\"Flying...\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\n✅ Summary:\n- Abstract Class = partial abstraction (can have logic)\n- Interface = full abstraction (only method signatures)\n- Use interface for flexibility and multiple inheritance."

        answer: "In Java, every class implicitly inherits from the `Object` class — the root class of the Java class hierarchy.\n\n✅ Common methods inherited from `Object`:\n- `toString()` → returns a string representation of the object\n- `equals(Object obj)` → compares two objects for equality\n- `hashCode()` → returns hash code of the object (used in hashing structures)\n- `clone()` → creates and returns a copy of the object (requires `Cloneable` interface)\n- `getClass()` → returns runtime class of the object\n\nJava Example:\n```java\nclass Student {\n  String name;\n  Student(String name) {\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n\n  public String toString() {\n    return \"Student name: \" + name;\n  }\n}\n\npublic class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Student s1 = new Student(\"Aman\");\n    System.out.println(s1.toString()); // Output: Student name: Aman\n    System.out.println(s1.getClass()); // Output: class Student\n  }\n}\n```\n\n✅ Summary:\n- `Object` class methods provide basic functionality to all Java objects.\n- You can override methods like `toString()` and `equals()` to customize behavior."
